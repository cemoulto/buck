    # Because the bulk of the logic to test in JavaDepsFinder requires a TargetGraph,
    # and it is considerably easier to define a TargetGraph by creating sample projects
    # under testdata/ than it is to  construct one programmatically, it makes
    # sense to use Buck's integration test framework to verify JavaDepsFinder rather
    # than a conventional unit test. Since the integration test framework is generally
    # driven by running a Buck subcommand, it makes sense for AutodepsCommandIntegrationTest
    # to be responsible for verifying JavaDepsFinder.
